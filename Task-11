Creating a Relationship Between the Existing Nodes

MATCH (a:LabeofNode1), (b:LabeofNode2)
WHERE a.name = "nameofnode1" AND b.name = " nameofnode2" CREATE (a)-[: Relation]->(b)
RETURN a,b


Deleting a Particular Node
To delete a particular node, you need to specify the details of the node in the place of “n” in the above query.

Syntax

Create(n:student { Sid: "VTU14502", Sname:"vijay",
deptname:"CSE"
})


OUTPUT

Create(n:dept{deptname:"cse",deptid:"d001"})


OUTPUT:
Added 1 label, created 1 node, set 2 properties, completed after 72 ms.


Select all the nodes in your database using match command


match(n) return(n)


OUTPUT






















match(n:student) return(n)


OUTPUT:



Create relationship between student and cse .


MATCH(s:student),(d:dept) WHERE s.Sname ='vijay' AND d.deptname=' cse'
CREATE(s)-[st:STUDIED_AT]->(d)
return s,d






OUTPUT:

MATCH(s:student),(d:dept) WHERE s.Sname ='John' AND d.deptname=' cse'
CREATE(s)-[st:STUDIED_AT]->(d)
return s,d


OUTPUT:












match(n) return(n)
























Delete a node from student


match(n:student{Sname:'Dharsana'}) DELETE(n)


OUTPUT:
Deleted 1 node, complaeted after 10834 ms.
